# Fadi-Restaurant-ordering-system
A simple console-based restaurant ordering system written in C++.
The program displays a food menu, lets the customer choose items, select options (appetizers and soup sizes), and calculates the running total.
The user can order multiple items using a loop until they decide to stop.
